        # could take. Since we are dealing with tetromino pieces don't forget that they can rotate, thus
        # creating more possible options for the variable can take.

        # Return a list of values (a domain) for said variable in the form of ((row, col), rotation) where
        # (row, col) is a possible position on the grid.

        # Helpful Functions:
        # TetrominoUtil.rotation_limit(tetromino) --> returns the maximum amount of rotations which the tetromino
        #                                             can take before resulting in its original position.
        # Tetromino.get_pruned_dimensions() --> Returns row_count, col_count of the tetromino pruned piece.
